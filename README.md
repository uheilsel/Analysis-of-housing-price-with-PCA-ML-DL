#  Beijing Second-Hand housing price pre-processing and prediction

### With pre-processing(dimension reduction, feature deletion, and downsampling) and visulization towards the source data, I applied PCA models and machine/deep learning models(PLS,MLR, and Random Forest) to conduct analysis and then to make predictions on the second-hand housing prices in Beijing from 2009 to 2018. An overall view of methodologies applied could be found in the report "SEP767_Hu_Jukai_finalReport".pdf under the Abstract and Introduction part. A comprehensive analysis report along with the related source codings are available as "SEP767_Hu_Jukai_finalReport".pdf and "SEP767_final_project_ipynb".ipynb respectively. The generated figures in the source code are also listed seperatedly in "SEP767_Hu_Jukai_finalReport_figurePage".pdf
