#  Second-Hand housing price pre-processing and prediction

### With pre-processing and visulization towards the source data, I applied PCA models and machine/deep learning models to conduct analysis and then to make predictions on the second-hand housing prices in Beijing from a certain period. A comprehensive final report along with the related source codings are available as "SEP767_Hu_Jukai_finalReport".pdf and "SEP767_final_project_ipynb".ipynb respectively. The generated figures in the source code are also listed seperatedly in "SEP767_Hu_Jukai_finalReport_figurePage".pdf
